# MovieMates

Group project #3 at Vefskólinn winter semester 2023

Group members are: Svanlaug, Viktor and Björk

We collaborated through Slack and did a design sprint for our movie app that displays movies
being shown in theaters. Friends can pick a movie to suggest for the next group trip to
the cinema.

Project was made with Vite, React and stylized with tailwind.
